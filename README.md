# Algorithms-In-Java

'Algorithms in Java' keeps programs from the "Algorithms and data structures" held at the University of Technology in Wrocław (Politechnika Wrocławska). The course included algorithms and self-implemented data structures such as simple and effective sorting algorithms, comparators, leneal and binary searches, priority queues, heaps, binary/read-bleck/b/interval tree, graph algorithm (including dijkstra and kruskal), pattern matching, huffman codes, knapsack problems. 

I apologize in advance for the polish names of variables and functions. At the time when I wrote these programs, I was not yet paying attention to the readability of the code and the correct naming of variables.
